# Anth-Digital-Story-

One of my classes this semester takes place completely outdoors.  Every week we go for a walks in various local parks.  At this time of year, everything is in the process of changing:  maple trees light up like candles, sunlight falls lower and casts a cool glow, and geese decorate the sky with their V-formations.  Soon darkness and cold will wrap its arms around us.
