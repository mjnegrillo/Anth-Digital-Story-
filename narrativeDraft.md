# Anth-Digital-Story-

One of my classes this semester takes place completely outdoors.  Every week we go for walks in various local parks.  At this time of year, everything is in the process of changing:  maple trees light up like candles, sunlight falls lower and casts a cool glow, and geese decorate the sky with their V-formations.  It is also the beginning of storm season.  One day we trekked through Delta Watershed Park
while torrential rain awoke the forest.  Another class was cancelled because the wind was strong enough to knock down giant trees.  

These conditions might not seem ideal, risky even.  But it is the perfect time to witness the power that nature has, its resilience and healing quality.  There is a lot to learn from the plants and animals we share the Earth with. 

At Redwood Park in South Surrey, there is a fairy village.  Tiny homes line nearly every log in this part of the forest and hang from branches like Christmas ornaments, painted bright colours and shining with jewels.  A sign tells people to only use natural materials found in the forest; clearly, people have ignored these intructions.  

I decide to build my own fairy door.  When I was a kid, I had an imaginary friend named Pebbles.  She was a fairy, using magic to control the weather, the colours of the leaves, the sound of geese. She was powerful but small.  As I constructed my fairy door of small wood chips, maple leaves, and sticks, I thought of Pebbles and where she might be now.  I hoped she might find this door in the fairy world and come visit me in _this_ world.
