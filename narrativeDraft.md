One of my classes this semester takes place completely outdoors.  Every week we go for walks in various local parks.  At this time of year, everything is in the process of changing:  maple trees light up like candles, sunlight falls lower and casts a cool glow, and geese decorate the sky with their V-formations.  It is also the beginning of storm season.  One day we trekked through Delta Watershed Park
while torrential rain awoke the forest.  Another class was cancelled because the wind was strong enough to knock down giant trees.  

These conditions might not seem ideal, risky even.  But it is the perfect time to witness the power that nature has, its resilience and healing quality.  There is a lot to learn from the plants and animals we share the Earth with. 

At Redwood Park in South Surrey, there is a fairy village.  Tiny homes line nearly every log in this part of the forest and hang from branches like Christmas ornaments, painted bright colours and shining with jewels.  A sign tells people to only use natural materials found in the forest; clearly, people have ignored these intructions.  

I decide to build my own fairy door.  When I was a kid, I had an imaginary friend named Pebbles.  She was a fairy, using magic to control the weather, the colours of the leaves, the sound of geese. She was powerful but small.  I construct my fairy door with small wood chips, maple leaves, and sticks, and I think of Pebbles and where she might be now.  Perhaps she will find this door in the fairy world and visit this one. 

I step back and notice that something is missing.  I build a leaf path so that others can follow it and find the entrance to a whole new world.  Holes like the one Alice falls through exist near the thick roots of most trees and these are doors to the real fairy homes beneath the Earth.  Here, fairies live in a complex society, invisible to most adults.  When you're a kid, it's easy to see.

It makes perfect sense as a child that
